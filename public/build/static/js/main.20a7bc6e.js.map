This\n\t *    may be done in the worker thread.\n\t *\n\t *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to\n\t *    trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want\n\t *    to extract any synthetic events.\n\t *\n\t *  - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with\n\t *    \"dispatches\", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.\n\t *\n\t *  - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.\n\t *\n\t * Overview of React and the event system:\n\t *\n\t * +------------+    .\n\t * |    DOM     |    .\n\t * +------------+    .\n\t *       |           .\n\t *       v           .\n\t * +------------+    .\n\t * | ReactEvent |    .\n\t * |  Listener  |    .\n\t * +------------+    .                         +-----------+\n\t *       |           .               +--------+|SimpleEvent|\n\t *       |           .               |         |Plugin     |\n\t * +-----|------+    .               v         +-----------+\n\t * |     |      |    .    +--------------+                    +------------+\n\t * |     +-----------.--->|EventPluginHub|                    |    Event   |\n\t * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  | Propagators|\n\t * | ReactEvent |    .    |              |     |TapEvent   |  |------------|\n\t * |  Emitter   |    .    |              |<---+|Plugin     |  |other plugin|\n\t * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  |  utilities |\n\t * |     +-----------.--->|              |                    +------------+\n\t * |     |      |    .    +--------------+\n\t * +-----|------+    .                ^        +-----------+\n\t *       |           .                |        |Enter/Leave|\n\t *       +           .                +-------+|Plugin     |\n\t * +-------------+   .                         +-----------+\n\t * | application |   .\n\t * |-------------|   .\n\t * |             |   .\n\t * |             |   .\n\t * +-------------+   .\n\t *                   .\n\t *    React Core     .
