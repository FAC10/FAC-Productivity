# FAC Classroom Apps

###Welcome

FAC classroom apps is a product platform designed to enhance learning in an open source, peer-lead environment, such as our coding bootcamps.

Based on the Founders and Coders method, our apps are designed to help students structure and optimise their learning experience.

For instance, our 20-20-20 timer... etc.

There is also the possibility to connect these apps to an LED display screen via a Raspberry Pi.

The idea behind the LED screen is to make the user interface an interactive part of the space, and to demonstrate that students' coding skills can be applied to projects beyond website development.
