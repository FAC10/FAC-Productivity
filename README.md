### Welcome!

FAC Productivity Tools is home to a range of tools made by students for students. Inspired by the Founders and Coders methods, they are designed to help facilitate learning and structure project work. 

There is also the possibility to connect these apps to an LED display screen via a Raspberry Pi (see the [Matrix branch](https://github.com/yvonne-liu/FAC-Productivity/tree/matrix) of this repo).

The idea behind the LED screen is to make the user interface an interactive part of the space, and to demonstrate that students' coding skills can be applied to projects beyond website development.
